<h3>What is Invader?</h3>
Invader is a bash script for kali linux to automate the information gathering and vulnerability scanning phase.

<h3>How to use it?</h3>
Use git clone to download and run in your Kali linux Distro.

To run:
<code>sudo chmod +x invader.sh</code>
<code>./invader.sh</code>

And Invader will do the rest by creating a directory for your target and storing the results of each tool in their own text files.
